I'm an analyst at the Bank of England, now starting as an economics PhD student at the University of Cambridge.

My research interests focus on <span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;"> macroeconomics</span>, <span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">labour</span>, and <span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">firm dynamics</span>.
