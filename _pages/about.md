I'm an analyst at the Bank of England, now starting as an economics PhD student at the University of Cambridge.

My research interests focus on <span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;"> macroeconomics</span>, <span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">labour</span>, and <span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">firm dynamics</span>. 
I'm especially interested in how firms' investment and financing impact worker human capital and labour market outcomes. 

Previously, I worked at the Financial Conduct Authority in London and studied at the University of Edinburgh and Centro de Estudios Monetarios y Financieros (Cemfi) in Madrid.
