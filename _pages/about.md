I'm an analyst at the Bank of England, soon starting as an economics PhD student at the University of Cambridge.
Here is my [<span style="font-weight: bold;">CV</span>](/files/main_cv.pdf).

My research focuses on <span style="color: var(--danger-color); font-weight: bold;"> macroeconomics</span>, <span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">labour</span>, and <span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">firm dynamics</span>. 
I'm especially interested in how firms' investment decisions and financing conditions impact worker human capital and labour market outcomes. ABC

Previously, I worked at the Financial Conduct Authority in London and studied at Cemfi and the University of Edinburgh.
